# 🐃 yips 

> Yips is a postal service. Yip Yip.

## Project Status

This is an experimental project that I may abandon. It's fueled mostly out of boredom, an unreasonable dislike of most email clients and nostalgia for [a 2000s-era nickelodeon toon.](https://i.imgur.com/Pfc3Y5j.mp4) Feel free to contribute. 

The UI isn't fully decided on yet, but a working, non-colored draft exists in the [workshop file](workshop.md). Feel free to critique and change. 

## Setup and Run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Flaque/yips.git
